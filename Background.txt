British India expanded east of Bhutan in the early 19th century with the First Anglo-Burmese War. At the end of the war the Brahmaputra valley of Assam came under its control and over the next few decades British India extended its direct administration over the region in stages. The thickly forested hill tracts surrounding the valley were inhabited by tribal people, who were not easily amenable to British administrative control. The British were content to leave them alone. In 1873, the British drew an "Inner Line" as an administrative line to inhibit their subjects from encroaching into the tribal territory within its control.[25][26] The British boundary, also called the "Outer Line", was defined to mark the limits of British jurisdiction. But it was not significantly different from the Inner Line in this region.[27]

The British wanted peaceful relations with the Himalayan tribes who lived beyond the Outer Line.[28] However, British influence was nevertheless extended to many regions, through treaties, trade relations, and occasional punitive expeditions in response to "outrages" committed against British civilians.[29][30] There is evidence that the British regarded the Assam Himalayan region as a geographical part of India irrespective of political jurisdiction.[31] Guyot-RÃ©chard sees them as having extended "external sovereignty" over the Assam Himalayan tribes.
