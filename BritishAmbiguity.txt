Simla was initially rejected by the Government of India as incompatible with the 1907 Anglo-Russian Convention.[citation needed] C. U. Aitchison's A Collection of Treaties, was published with a note stating that no binding agreement had been reached at Simla.[44] The Anglo-Russian Convention was jointly renounced by Russia and Britain in 1921,[45][non-primary source needed] but the McMahon Line was forgotten until 1935, when interest was revived by civil service officer Olaf Caroe.[citation needed] The Survey of India published a map showing the McMahon Line as the official boundary in 1937.[citation needed] In 1938, the British published the Simla Accord in Aitchison's Treaties.[44] A volume published earlier was recalled from libraries and replaced with a volume that includes the Simla Accord together with an editor's note stating that Tibet and Britain, but not China, accepted the agreement as binding.[46][non-primary source needed] The replacement volume has a false 1929 publication date.[44]

In April 1938, a small British force led by Captain G. S. Lightfoot arrived in Tawang and informed the monastery that the district was now Indian territory.[47] The Tibetan government protested and its authority was restored after Lightfoot's brief stay. The district remained in Tibetan hands until 1951. However, Lhasa raised no objection to British activity in other sectors of the McMahon Line. In 1944, the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFT) established direct administrative control for the entire area it was assigned, although Tibet soon regained authority in Tawang.
